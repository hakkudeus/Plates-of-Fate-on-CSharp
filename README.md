One of Roblox's place mechanics recreated on C#

This code contains only GUI and only the smallest possible beginnings of actual scripted events.
Made with Visual Studio C# 2008. This is my first CSharp experience, but I couldn't finish this project due to my personal problems that are unrelated to programming.
